# Setting up Open Project using Docker Desktop

#### INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this project is to deploy **OpenProject**, an open-source project management software, using Docker Desktop. This exercise demonstrates how containerization simplifies software deployment and provides a scalable, efficient way to run applications. Through this project, we explore concepts such as Docker image containers, port forwarding, and software accessibility via localhost.
